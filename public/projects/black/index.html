<h2 id="what-is-black-">What is <code>Black</code> ?</h2>
<p>Black is a</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>simplistic</strong>,</li>
<li><code>anonymous</code>,</li>
<li>low-profile <br>
theme.</li>
</ul>
<div class="divider"  ></div>
<p>Designed with the afore mentioned values in mind, <code>black</code> strives to reduce <br>
clutter by removing anything unnecessary and improve readability by maximizing <br>
the contrasts between text and backgrounds. <br>
<br>
Using simple, globally tested fonts, such as <strong>Inter</strong>, or <code>Geist Mono</code> reduces strain <br>
on your eyes. <br>
<br>
However. <br>
Nobody wants a dry, monochrome theme for their website.
That&rsquo;s where effects such as <br>
<span class="anim-link">this</span> (hover over me!) <br>
come into play. <br>
<br>
By changing everytime your site is loaded, your user never knows what to expect.</p>
<p>By the way, this site uses Black.</p>
<div class="divider"  ></div>
<h2 id="why-black">Why Black?</h2>
<p>Black is a theme for the static-site generator hugo. (well, what is that supposed to mean?) <br>
Being extremely easy to use, hugo uses <code>Markdown</code> for text.</p>
<p>Markdown is extremely simple to use. Most services today with text input already have markdown, <br>
and you may not even notice it. <br>
Ever typed two (or one) asterisks (*) after one another to make your text bold? <br>
Well, <br>
<br>
That&rsquo;s markdown.</p>
<p>Black also has built-in shortcodes*, such as <code>{{&lt;spacer&gt;}}</code> or <code>{{&lt;divider&gt;}}</code>, both inspired <br>
by SwiftUI&rsquo;s <code>Spacer()</code> and <code>Divider()</code></p>
<div class="divider"  ></div>
<h2 id="why-did-i-make-black">Why did I make <code>Black</code>?</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of websites on the internet, I&rsquo;m sure everybody has. <br>
But every now and then I see one that <strong>really</strong> impresses me. <br>
I found one of those, and it did just that. <br>
A month later, when I was planning on making a website, I thought about that one. I tried to find it again in my search history, but I didn&rsquo;t. <br>
So, because I liked it so much, I tried to remake it from memory. <br>
Maybe one day the original creator will reach out to me. Maybe not.</p>
<div class="divider"  ></div>
<h2 id="why-unotu-black">Why <u>not</u> Black?</h2>
<ol>
<li>Black doesn&rsquo;t have full mobile support yet, meaning some things will glitch out, <br>
or not appear as you expect them to.</li>
<li>Black isn&rsquo;t a professional project. This is just one of my hobbies, so if you want new features, <br>
It might take a long time for them to be implemented. Or you&rsquo;d have to implement them yourself.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<h2 id="im-convinced-where-can-i-get-black">I&rsquo;m convinced. Where can I get black?</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, you can&rsquo;t right now. Black is still under heavy development. <br>
Keep checking in for updates. <br>
<br>
<br>
Even if you weren&rsquo;t convinced, Hugo&rsquo;s community still has plenty of great themes to offer.
