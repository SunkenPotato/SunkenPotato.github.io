## Helldivers is insane(ly good).

Ok, so, story. \
My friend and I have been playing Fortnite since a year or something. Disagreeing with the updates, the content, the sweats, and all the bad microtransactions, we set off to find another game. \
We devoted an entire *\***ing afternoon to looking for a game. We came preeeety close a few times to finding one, but it just didn't feel good enough. \
Some (strong) (marked with *) contenders were: \
- A way out - Hazelight *
- Rust - Facepunch Studios *
- Destiny - Bungie
- Call of Duty
