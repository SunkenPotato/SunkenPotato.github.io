# Website

### Theme & Content

I've designed the theme as well as the content. **All of it**. I once saw this theme on someone's website. Then i forgot it ðŸ™„. So, being the person I am, I kind of tried to remake it. \
\
This site is generated by [hugo](https://gohugo.io). \
\
I'm still making it, so don't criticise me **just** yet.
