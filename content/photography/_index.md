## Photography and I
I don't take Photography too seriously. \
Sometimes for fun, or when I go out for walks. \
I have a Sony α6300 with the kit lens (`16-50mm 3.5-5.6ƒ`) and edit with Adobe Lightroom \
Feel free to share pictures with others, but you **have to** reference me or my website in some way.
